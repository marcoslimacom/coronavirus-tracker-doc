There are 3 parts of the code identified as `CSS`, `Content` and `Javascript`.
You can copy all the content and add it where you want the coranavirus dashboard to appear. However, it is a good practice, but not mandatory, to add each part in its proper place:
The `CSS` part inside the `HEAD` tag, the `Javascript` part at the bottom of the page, before the `BODY` tag closes and the Content part where you want the coronavirus dashboad to appear. At the end add the `static` folder in the right place around your page.
